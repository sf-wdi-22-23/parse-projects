# Basic Parse
This is about as basic as it gets. On load we query the table. An HTML form lets you create simple Parse objects using vanilla JavaScript (sans jQuery). Submit the form and the list will update -- you don't even need to run a server!

## Challenges:

1. Integrate code from another project
1. Add Angular
1. Add users with Parse authentication
